Dimensionality Reduction
========================

Encompasses both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques:

1. Linear Dimensionality Reduction: This submodule offers functionalities for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on Voltage Sensitive Dye Imaging (VSDI) data.

2. Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction: This submodule provides functionalities for training, analyzing, and performing various operations with Convolutional Autoencoders (Conv_AE).
