Dimensionality Reduction
========================

.. automodule:: pipeline_vsdi.dim_reduction

Encompasses both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques:

1. Dimensionality Reduction: This submodule offers functionalities for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on Voltage Sensitive Dye Imaging (VSDI) data, a type of data commonly used in neuroscience for imaging brain activity.

2. Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction: This submodule provides functionalities for training, analyzing, and performing various operations with Convolutional Autoencoders (Conv_AE). This is useful for the compression and reconstruction of image data, making it particularly valuable in fields like computer vision and medical imaging.
